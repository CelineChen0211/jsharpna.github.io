      <h3>Why Python?</h3>
      <p>
	Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum because the popular procedural languages of the time (perl, C, Fortran, etc.) were deficient for many common tasks.
	C (Dennis Ritchie, 1973) is great for writing fast optimized code, but it suffers from flexibility because of the need to declare variables, and the thin layer of abstraction (you are a bit closer to the machine).
	Perl (Larry Wall, 1987) is great for writing scripts that interacted with unix, processed strings, and being able to do this quickly with minimal effort.	
	One common complaint of Perl is that it was very easy to write nearly unreadable code in Perl (aka line garbage), and it is filled with heuristics.
	Python is like Perl in that there is sufficient abstraction to write code without thinking too much about memory allocation and type compatibility, but unlike Perl, it emphasizes readibility.
	Python and Perl are both interpreted languages, meaning that they come with interpreters that will run code line by line as you execute them, while C is compiled, meaning that you write code and then a program, called a compiler, converts it into machine code (code that the CPU can directly read).
      </p>

      <p>
	For these reasons, Python's popularity has grown, so that now it is the 2nd most popular language after Java.
	One advantage of this is that there exist tons of great packages for Python, such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.
	That is why we use Python for data science.  Matlab and C++ are going to be typically faster, but it is often wiser to go out and find a package that already implements what you want to do, so that you don't have to code everything from scratch (and it will probably be a much faster implementation).
	While most of this course will be about using different packages in python, you need to learn the basic python syntax, because inevitably you will need to program basic things by hand.
      </p>

      <h3>Python Syntax</h3>
      There are many python basics resources online, here is a short list:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/python.html">Norm Matloff's python material</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">The Python Homepage</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction">Google's intro to Python</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/331/notes/PythonBasics.pdf">These course notes, S.R. Doty</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Checkpoint 1: Go through the Google course's <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction">introduction section (single page)</a>.</h4>
      
      <p><b>Variable Type</b> determines how the variable is stored and manipulated.
	Try the following commands in ipython:
	<ul>
	  <li><code>1 + 4</code></li>
	  <li><code>['a','b'] + ['c']</code></li>
	  <li><code>'ab' + 'c'</code></li>
	  <li><code>True + False</code></li>
	  <li><code>{'141A':1, '141B': 2} + {'141C': 3}</code></li>
	</ul>
	So + does different things based on the type.
	You can see what the type of these objects are with <code>type([variable])</code>.
	For integers + is addition, for lists and strings + concatenates, for boolean + converts them into integers first (1 or 0) and then adds, and for dictionaries + is undefined.
	In fact, you can make your own variable types (called classes) and redefine + for that class.
	Doing this is an example of object oriented programming, and redefining + is an example of overloading operators.
