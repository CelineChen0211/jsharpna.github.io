      <h3>Why Python?</h3>
      <p>
	Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum because the popular procedural languages of the time (perl, C, Fortran, etc.) were deficient for many common tasks.
	C (Dennis Ritchie, 1973) is great for writing fast optimized code, but it suffers from flexibility because of the need to declare variables, and the thin layer of abstraction (you are a bit closer to the machine).
	Perl (Larry Wall, 1987) is great for writing scripts that interacted with unix, processed strings, and being able to do this quickly with minimal effort.	
	One common complaint of Perl is that it was very easy to write nearly unreadable code in Perl (aka line garbage), and it is filled with heuristics.
	Python is like Perl in that there is sufficient abstraction to write code without thinking too much about memory allocation and type compatibility, but unlike Perl, it emphasizes readibility.
	Python and Perl are both interpreted languages, meaning that they come with interpreters that will run code line by line as you execute them, while C is compiled, meaning that you write code and then a program, called a compiler, converts it into machine code (code that the CPU can directly read).
      </p>

      <p>
	For these reasons, Python's popularity has grown, so that now it is the 2nd most popular language after Java.
	One advantage of this is that there exist tons of great packages for Python, such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.
	That is why we use Python for data science.  Matlab and C++ are going to be typically faster, but it is often wiser to go out and find a package that already implements what you want to do, so that you don't have to code everything from scratch (and it will probably be a much faster implementation).
	While most of this course will be about using different packages in python, you need to learn the basic python syntax, because inevitably you will need to program basic things by hand.
      </p>

      <h3>Python Syntax</h3>
      <p>
      There are many python basics resources online, here is a short list:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/python.html">Norm Matloff's python material</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">The Python Homepage</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction">Google's intro to Python</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/331/notes/PythonBasics.pdf">These course notes, S.R. Doty</a></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h4>Checkpoint 1: Go through the Google course's <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction">introduction section (single page)</a>.</h4>

	<b>Computing your age:</b> A little example of writing modular code and if statements.  Pardon my lapse in the middle, I got a bit confused for no reason <a href="code/birthday.py">(code)</a>
      </div>

      <h4>Checkpoint 2: Go through the Google course sections: <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings">Strings, Lists, Sorting (read list comprehensions), Dicts and Files</a>.  While you read this you should have ipython open and try some of the test code there.</h4>

      <h3>Elements of Style</h3>
      <p>In order to write nice code, you should do a few things. (This was partially derived from <a href="https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf">the python guide</a>)
	<ul>
	  <li>Modularize your code with def</li>
	  <li>Make somewhat informative variable names (don't just use a,b,c,...)</li>
	  <li>Write comments (or markdown in Jupyter) explaining what you're doing</li>
	  <li>Break complicated things into multiple lines</li>
	</ul>
	There are many python idioms (coding practices) that are pythonic.
	One such thing is tuple unpacking, where you assign values to multiple variables:
	<code>i,j = (1,2)</code>.  Here we assigned i=1 and j=2 in one line.
	Another is list comprehensions and generators.
	For example, if you want to create a list of the first 100 square numbers then you could use a for loop:
<pre><code>squares = []
for i in range(100):
    squares.append(i**2)</code></pre>
Or you could do it in one line with <code>squares = [i**2 for i in range(100)]</code>.
Here a new list was created with a new element for each i in the range(100) object (recall that range(100) returns a list of increasing integers from 1 to 100).
There are many other idioms that I hope you will pick up along the way.
Watch the following examples.

      </div>

      <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
      Suppose that we have many functions that we are using, many modules, many loops.
      Each of these will use dummy variable, and inevitably variable names will overlap.
      For example, suppose at some point in my code I set <code>i=1</code> and then much later I forgot this and used <code>i = j+1</code> as a temporary variable for some reason. 
      Then of course, I've lost my original value, which is a problem.

      Consider the following:

<pre><code>def addone(j):
    i = j+1
    return i

i = 1
j = addone(i)
print i
</code></pre>
If there was no such thing as variable scope, then the result would be 2, but because of variable scope, 1 is printed.
What happens is that your code has a namespace, which associates the variable name with objects in memory.
But the code that you are working on now only has access to it's namespace and the namespace of imported modules and the built-in namespace.
Functions for example create a local namespace which you do not have access to by default.
This actually is a way to make your coding managable, especially if you are like me, in that you have a very limited memory.
The scope of the variable refers to where in the code it is well defined, so the scope of i in addone is just that function, while i outside has global scope.

Global scope means that it can be accessed anywhere in the code.
So for example the following code works.
<pre><code>def printi():
    print i

i = 10
printi()</pre></code>
You can make a variable defined in a function with the <code>global</code> command, but it is a bad practice to rely on this, so let's not dwell on it.

      <h4>Checkpoint: by the end of this lesson, you should make sure you are familiar with the following...
	<ul>
	  <li>Basic python types: int, string, float, list, tuple, dict</li>
	  <li>Methods: ex. list.append(), string.split(), len(list)</li>
	  <li>Control & flow: if, then, else, for, while</li>
	  <li>List comprehensions and generator expressions</li>
	  <li>Variable scope</li>
	</ul>
