<h3>Matrices and Numpy</h3>

This lesson is based on the following links, and you can follow along with the jupyter notebook.

<p>Linear algebra is a powerful toolbox, and it is commonly listed as a necessary skill for data science and machine learning.
  We will deal with matrices and vectors in a less abstract way than in a pure math class.
  Namely, for our purposes, a matrix is an array of numbers and a vector is a list of numbers.
  We want to be able to easily do common operations like dot products, matrix multiplication, and element-wise operations.
  There are two reasons why we use the package numpy for this: one is that it is fast, the other is that most other packages that need linear algebra are based on numpy.
  We'll start with basics: initializing a matrix, printing, transpose, dot products.

<p>The array allows us to reshape it and slice it in a flexible way.
  This should be familiar to R users, in that the slicing can take a range, list, or boolean vector as it's input.
  Remember though that indexing in python starts at 0!  (There are other strange things because of this.)</p>

<p>Vectorization is when you apply the same operations to each element of an array.
  In the first video we saw that using numpy dot product sped up an operation by another order of magnitude over an implementation with for loops.
  You should always vectorize something whenever possible, and you may have to get creative to do it.
  When you write a for loop, then you should think to yourself, could this be vectorized with arrays?
  We'll go through some basic matrix operations, and anything leftover that I thought you should know.</p>
